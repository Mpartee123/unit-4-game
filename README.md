# unit-4-game

This project is a javascript and jquery based game that
generates random numbers for 4 html elements called "Crystals"

The user selects the elements and their values are added.

The objective of the game is to select the correct crystals
to total up to the "Number to guess"

When a win or loss is detected the win or loss is recorded
and the values and counter reset.

The project is a demonstration of running javascript to 
populate elements and use user input to effect elements in html.

To start all you have to do is start clicking the crystal images
and the script handles the rest.

You can get help with the project by leaving feedback on Github.com
